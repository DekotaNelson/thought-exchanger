# Thought Exchanger Web App
Have you ever been curious about what random thoughts other people experience? Well look no farther than this web app! This web application allows users to get 'thoughts' from other users as well as submit new 'thoughts' for other users to find via an easy to use interface.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, ejs, Heroku, CRUD, HTML, and CSS

Utilizing Node, Express, and MongoDB, I created a full stack application that serves users a randomized 'thought' on request. This app also accepts new post commands to allow users to add thier 'thoughts' for others to see. This is done through a custom server API I built with Node and Express with ejs for dynamic rendering. This is then all connected to a MongoDB database and hosted on Heroku.

# Lessons Learned:
This project allowed me to learn a lot in regards to MongoDB and Express. I was also able to learn about CRUD operations and managing users interatcing with these operations. This project also reinforced that, in general, everyday people are benevolent.
